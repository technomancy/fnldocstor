LÖVE will cal

The current batch will be automatically fl
ushed by love.graphics state changes (except for the transform stack and the
 current color), as well as Shader:send and methods on Textures which change
 their state. Using a different Image in consecutive love.graphics.draw call
s will also flush the current batch.

SpriteBatches, ParticleSystems, Meshes

By default the coordinate s
ystem in LÖVE corresponds to the display pixels in horizontal and vertical 
directions one-to-one, and the x-axis increases towards the right while the 
y-axis increases downwards. Scaling the coordinate system changes this relat
ion.

After scaling by sx and sy, all coordinates are treated as if they wer
e multiplied by sx and sy. Every result of a drawing operation is also corre
spondingly scaled, so scaling by (2, 2) for example would mean making everyt
hing twice as large in both x- and y-directions. Scaling by a negative value
 flips the coordinate system in the corresponding direction, which also mean
s everything will be drawn flipped or upside down, or both. Scaling by zero 
is not a useful operation.

Scale and translate are not commutative operatio
ns, therefore, calling them in different orders will change the outcome.

The 
pulley joint simulates a pulley with an optional block and tackle. If the ra
tio parameter has a value different from one, then the simulated rope extend
s faster on one side than the other. In a pulley joint the total length of t
he simulated rope is the constant length1 + ratio * length2, which is set wh
en the pulley joint is created.

Pulley joints can behave unpredictably if o
ne side is fully extended. It is recommended that the method setMaxLengths  
be used to constrain the maximum lengths each side can attain.
